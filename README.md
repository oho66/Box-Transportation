# Basic Elevator Design

The objective is  to categorize and transport different sizes of boxes such small, medium, and large items through different levels using two elevators. The working principle is that the largest boxes were assigned to the third floor as sensor read the dimensions and transported to the exit on the first floor using the elevator. When the object is ascending or descending via elevator, the lights on both elevators will be on. The elevator can only be activated for the next pallet after receiving one pallet on the exit for safety. Minor changes were adopted to the original scene expect the longer conveyor on the bottom and an exit slide to receive boxes.
